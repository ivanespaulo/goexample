One of the most useful data structures in computer science is the hash table. Many hash table implementations exist with varying properties, but in general they offer fast lookups, adds, and deletes.
Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table. where KeyType may be any type that is comparable (more on this later), and ValueType may be any type at all, including another map!
